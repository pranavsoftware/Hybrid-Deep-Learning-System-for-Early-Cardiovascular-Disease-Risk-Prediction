**Gap Identified in Prior Art:**

No existing system combines all three of the following in a single unified framework:
1. A **batch-normalized, dropout-regularized deep neural network** for tabular clinical CVD prediction
2. An **interactive risk simulation engine** that allows clinicians to perturb individual clinical features and observe quantified risk changes in real-time
3. **SHAP-based per-patient explainability** integrated at the model output level, providing both global feature ranking and local instance-level attribution

The present invention addresses this gap.

---

## 4. Summary and Background of the Invention (Addressing the Gap / Novelty)

### Background

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death globally, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths per year (World Health Organization). Early risk detection using routinely collected clinical parameters — such as blood pressure, cholesterol, ECG results, and exercise test outcomes — can significantly reduce mortality through timely intervention.

Traditional machine learning approaches (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost) have been widely applied to the Heart Disease UCI dataset and similar clinical datasets. However, these methods have fundamental limitations:

- **Linear models** (Logistic Regression) cannot capture complex non-linear feature interactions inherent in cardiovascular pathophysiology
- **Tree-based ensembles** (Random Forest, XGBoost) lack the differentiable, gradient-based optimization that enables smooth probability calibration on small datasets
- **Prior deep learning approaches** in cardiology predominantly focus on medical imaging (CT, MRI, echocardiography) and require expensive infrastructure, rather than leveraging readily available tabular clinical data
- **Existing systems lack an integrated risk simulation engine** — no prior tool allows a clinician to modify a single clinical parameter (e.g., lower cholesterol from 280 to 200 mg/dl) and instantly see the quantified impact on the patient's predicted risk
- **Explainability remains disconnected** — SHAP is typically applied post-hoc in research papers, not architecturally integrated into a deployable clinical decision support tool

### Novelty of the Present Invention

The present invention introduces a **unified three-component system** that is novel in its combination:

1. **HeartDiseaseNet — A Hybrid Deep Neural Network:** A PyTorch-based DNN with batch normalization, ReLU activation, and dropout regularization specifically architected for small-sample tabular clinical data (as few as 302 records). Unlike prior DNN approaches that require tens of thousands of samples, this architecture achieves 86.36% ROC-AUC on the standard Heart Disease UCI benchmark with only 241 training samples.

2. **Risk Simulation Engine:** A novel `simulate_risk_change()` module that operates on the trained model's inference pipeline. Given a patient's clinical profile, a clinician can programmatically modify any single feature (e.g., cholesterol, blood pressure, heart rate) and receive an instant report showing: original risk probability, modified risk probability, and percentage change. This enables **counterfactual clinical reasoning** — a capability absent from all prior art surveyed.

3. **Integrated SHAP Explainability:** The SHAP KernelExplainer is directly coupled to the DNN's prediction function, providing both a global feature importance ranking and per-patient local explanations. This ensures that every prediction is transparent, auditable, and clinically interpretable — meeting emerging regulatory requirements for AI in healthcare (EU AI Act, FDA guidance on AI/ML-based SaMD).

**The integration of these three components into a single end-to-end pipeline — from raw clinical data to explainable, simulatable risk predictions — constitutes the core novelty of this invention.**

---

## 5. Objective(s) of Invention

The primary objectives of the present invention are:

1. **To develop a deep learning model** capable of accurately predicting the binary presence or absence of cardiovascular disease from 13 standard clinical features, achieving performance superior to traditional machine learning baselines on the Heart Disease UCI dataset.

2. **To design a regularized neural network architecture** (with batch normalization and dropout) that generalizes effectively on small clinical datasets (N < 500), overcoming the data-hungry nature of conventional deep learning.

3. **To create a Risk Simulation Engine** that enables clinicians to perform interactive what-if analyses by modifying individual patient features and observing the quantified impact on predicted cardiovascular risk, thereby supporting personalized treatment planning and patient counseling.

4. **To integrate model-agnostic SHAP explainability** directly into the prediction pipeline, providing:
   - Global feature importance rankings to identify which clinical factors most influence the model's decisions overall
   - Per-patient local attributions to explain why the model assigned a specific risk probability to an individual patient

5. **To generate reproducible, publication-quality visualizations** (correlation matrix, class distribution, training loss curve, ROC curve, SHAP summary plots) that support clinical validation, regulatory submission, and research dissemination.

6. **To deliver a fully reproducible, end-to-end computational pipeline** packaged as a single Jupyter Notebook that is portable, well-documented, and ready for clinical research demonstration or deployment integration.

```

**In brief:** Raw clinical data is preprocessed and standardized, then fed into a two-hidden-layer deep neural network that outputs a calibrated disease probability. The trained model is then used by two downstream modules — a risk simulation engine for what-if analysis and a SHAP explainer for transparent feature attribution — producing clinically actionable outputs.

```

**Total Parameters:** 10,497 (all trainable)

**Parameter Breakdown:**
- Hidden Layer 1: (13 × 128) + 128 bias + 128 BN weight + 128 BN bias = 1,920
- Hidden Layer 2: (128 × 64) + 64 bias + 64 BN weight + 64 BN bias = 8,384
- Output Layer: (64 × 1) + 1 bias = 65
- **Total: 10,497 − 128 running mean/var (non-trainable)**

**Training Configuration:**
- Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy (`BCELoss`)
- Optimizer: Adam (learning rate = 0.001)
- Training Epochs: 50
- Batch Size: 32
- Data Split: 80% training (241 samples) / 20% test (61 samples), stratified

### 7.4 Module B — Risk Simulation Engine

The risk simulation engine is implemented as the function `simulate_risk_change(input_data, modified_feature, new_value)`:

**Algorithm:**

```
FUNCTION simulate_risk_change(patient_features, feature_name, new_value):

    1. Create original_vector from patient_features dictionary
    2. Standardize original_vector using fitted scaler
    3. Feed through trained model → old_risk = P(disease | original)

    4. Create modified_vector by copying original and setting feature_name = new_value
    5. Standardize modified_vector using same fitted scaler
    6. Feed through trained model → new_risk = P(disease | modified)

    7. Compute percentage_change = ((new_risk - old_risk) / old_risk) × 100

    8. RETURN {old_risk, new_risk, percentage_change}
```

**Key Design Properties:**
- Operates on raw (unscaled) clinical values for intuitive clinician interaction
- Applies the same standardization pipeline as training for consistency
- Produces calibrated probability outputs (0–1) via the sigmoid function
- Reports percentage change to quantify the relative impact of the modification

### 7.5 Module C — SHAP Explainability Engine

The explainability module uses SHAP KernelExplainer, which is model-agnostic and works with any differentiable or non-differentiable model:

**Process:**
1. A prediction wrapper function `predict_fn(x)` is defined that accepts a NumPy array, converts it to a PyTorch tensor, runs the model in evaluation mode, and returns the probability output
2. A background dataset of 50 training samples is selected to approximate the expected model output
3. The `KernelExplainer` computes Shapley values for each feature of each test instance, measuring each feature's marginal contribution to the prediction
4. Results are visualized as:
   - **SHAP Summary (Beeswarm) Plot** — showing per-feature, per-patient impact with color-coded feature values
   - **Mean Absolute SHAP Bar Chart** — ranking features by average importance

### 7.6 Visualization Outputs

The system generates five publication-quality PNG visualizations:

## 9. What Aspect(s) of the Invention Need(s) Protection?

The following aspects of the invention are sought to be protected under intellectual property rights:

### 9.1 Core System Architecture (Patent Protection)

- **The integrated three-module system** comprising: (a) a batch-normalized, dropout-regularized deep neural network for tabular clinical CVD prediction, (b) a single-feature perturbation risk simulation engine, and (c) SHAP-based explainability — all operating on a unified data pipeline with shared preprocessing and model inference components.

### 9.2 Risk Simulation Engine Method (Patent Protection)

- **The method of computing counterfactual cardiovascular risk** by: accepting a patient's raw clinical feature vector, applying a trained standardization transform, passing through a trained neural network to obtain a baseline risk probability, then programmatically modifying a single specified clinical feature, re-standardizing, re-inferring, and computing both the absolute risk difference and percentage change — thereby enabling clinicians to quantify the predicted impact of clinical interventions before they are administered.

### 9.3 Neural Network Architecture for Small-Sample Clinical Data (Patent Protection)

- **The specific HeartDiseaseNet architecture** designed to achieve high discriminative performance (ROC-AUC > 0.85) on clinical datasets with fewer than 500 samples, through the combination of: batch normalization layers for training stability, 30% dropout for regularization, a two-hidden-layer topology (128 → 64 neurons) with ReLU activation, and a sigmoid output layer producing calibrated risk probabilities — specifically optimized for the 13-feature cardiovascular clinical feature space.

### 9.4 Integrated Explainability Pipeline (Patent Protection)

- **The method of coupling SHAP KernelExplainer directly to a deep neural network's inference function** within a clinical decision support system, using a background training sample to compute Shapley values for each patient's prediction, and presenting results as both (a) a global feature importance ranking sorted by mean absolute SHAP value and (b) per-patient beeswarm plots with color-coded feature value overlays — tailored for cardiovascular clinical interpretation.

### 9.5 Software Implementation (Copyright Protection)

- **The complete source code** implementing the end-to-end pipeline as embodied in the Jupyter Notebook `main.ipynb`, including all data preprocessing routines, model class definitions, training loops, evaluation functions, risk simulation logic, SHAP integration code, and visualization generation code.

### 9.6 Visualization Outputs (Copyright Protection)

- **The specific set of five diagnostic visualizations** (correlation matrix, class distribution, training loss curve, ROC curve, SHAP feature importance summary) as a coordinated output suite designed for clinical research demonstration and regulatory submission.
